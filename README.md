# Hey! I'm Alex

My name is Alexander Reyes. I'm a 19-year-old student and I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree here in New York State

I'm interested in Full Stack Development, but I am currently studying Front-end development. I have just started getting into this field not so long ago, so I am kind of new. I am eager to learn more! If you have any feedback about any of my projects please do not hesitate to let me know, I will be more than happy!

A few fun facts about me:
- I'm from Peru 🇵🇪
- I like dogs and cats 🐕 🐈
- I love playing games 🎮
- I like going to the gym 🏋️‍♂️

I'm looking foward to learning more about coding!
